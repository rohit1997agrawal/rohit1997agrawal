👋 Hey there! I'm Rohit Agrawal, a Full Stack Developer on a mission to build the digital future, one line of code at a time. With a passion for crafting elegant solutions to complex problems, I dive deep into the realms of technology to create innovative applications that leave a lasting impact.

💻 My tech arsenal includes mastery in JavaScript (ReactJS, Angular) for dynamic front-end experiences, and Java (Springboot, Jersey) for robust back-end architecture. I wield the power of MVC, SQL (PostgreSQL), Microservices, and REST APIs to ensure seamless communication and scalability.

🛠️ With AWS as my playground, I orchestrate cloud solutions that elevate performance and reliability to new heights. From concept to deployment, I'm dedicated to delivering high-quality, user-centric applications that exceed expectations.
